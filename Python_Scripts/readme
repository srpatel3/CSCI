FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 
ASSIGNMENT1
Author : Shirish Patel

I have removed the test code from source file and tried to keep only new code in this file. All the test cases for all the functions are 
there, commented out. For running any of them you can remove the commens for that sections and Run it.

For simplify function I have added some functionalities like x*1 = x, x*0 = 0
Same Goes for division x/1 = x and 0/x = 0
For Cosine and Sine functions I have added Const return for 0 and 90 values of Cosine and Sine.


The code I have submitted is solely my own and I have to taken any external help.

If you have any question at any point, I will be more than happy to clear it out.
